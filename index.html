    <div class="about">
      <p>Sleeping AI—we’re here to disrupt, change, and reinvent SOTA.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>We are a frontier AI research lab dedicated to expanding human perspectives on artificial intelligence and exploring its deep integration into society to accelerate our path toward a Tier 1 civilization.</p>
      <p>Our focus is on tackling overlooked challenges and underexplored subfields where innovation is urgently needed. Unlike OpenAI or DeepMind, we refuse to constrain ourselves to a single architecture or predefined path. Instead, we operate as a collective of research hackers—pushing boundaries, questioning norms, and pursuing breakthroughs that others ignore.</p>
      <p>Scalability, real-world impact, and the long-term future are at the core of everything we do.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>In a world where OpenAI, Safe Superintelligence, and DeepMind dominate the AI landscape, we are not in a race to define or claim AGI. We make no grand promises of achieving it first—because that is not our mission.</p>
      <p>We exist for a far simpler yet more critical purpose: AI research needs a lab that explores the vast, overlooked subfields of artificial intelligence, commits to open-source principles, and publishes freely for the advancement of humanity. That is why, while we call ourselves a lab, we are, in reality, a collective—a group of ambitious, relentless individuals who push the boundaries of research, regardless of the controversy or resistance we may face.</p>
      <p>In the future, we aim to become investors, spinning off our research into independent startups that will challenge the dominance of larger labs and corporations. Yet, <i>Sleeping AI</i> itself will remain untethered—driven not by profit, but by the pursuit of knowledge and the relentless push for AI that serves humanity.</p>
