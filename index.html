    <div class="about">
      <p>Sleeping AI, a fortiner lab working in the domain of artificial intelligence such as audio, speech, and Natural Language Processing. We believe in pushing known boundaries and publishing datasets and models that are unorthodox + edgy. By unorthodox, we mean datasets and models that are less-explored and can become a future SOTA field if enough attention is provided.</p>
      <p>Obviously not all methodologies can become SOTA, but we choose our research course based on real-world usefulness and based on past and present research trends. We have no intention of becoming the next language model research lab; we are interested in learning and using Artificial Intelligence. Still, we do language model research, but it does not act as our silver bullet for all problemsâ€™ answers. Rather a research domain that has interesting prospects.</p>
      <p>We are now in limited Alpha and looking for investors, while working with friendly labs as side-quests to contribute to the artificial intelligence domain. Please note we have planned to publish papers throughout 2025 at different conferences, and at the same time, we have already published some nice-looking datasets.</p>
